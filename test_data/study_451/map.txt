Therefore, we hypothesized that this organ could be a sensitive reporter of adaptive changes during periods of nutrient deprivation that involve the gut microbiota. In the current report, we use gnotobiotic mice to identify a metabolic cross-talk between liver and heart that is influenced by the gut microbiota. This cross-talk, which is apparent during fasting, is centered around ketone body utilization and shapes myocardial metabolism and size. Male GF mice were colonized at 6_10 weeks with a single gavage of cecal contents that had been harvested from adult CONV-R donors and resuspended in PBS (5 mL per donor; 500 _L of this suspension administered per recipient). Recipients were subsequently kept in gnotobiotic isolators and maintained for 2_3 weeks on a CARB diet. Animals were then either fasted for 24 h or continued on the CARB diet. A subset of GF and CONV-D mice was fed an irradiated sterile ketogenic diet (95.1% fat, 4.5% protein, 0.1% carbohydrate, Bio-Serv AIN-76A) for 30 days. All animals in all treatment groups were killed in mid-morning.

In the current report, we use gnotobiotic mice to identify a metabolic cross-talk between liver and heart that is influenced by the gut microbiota. This cross-talk, which is apparent during fasting, is centered around ketone body utilization and shapes myocardial metabolism and size. Male GF mice were colonized at 6_10 weeks with a single gavage of cecal contents that had been harvested from adult CONV-R donors and resuspended in PBS (5 mL per donor; 500 _L of this suspension administered per recipient). Recipients were subsequently kept in gnotobiotic isolators and maintained for 2_3 weeks on a CARB diet. Animals were then either fasted for 24 h or continued on the CARB diet. A subset of GF and CONV-D mice was fed an irradiated sterile ketogenic diet (95.1% fat, 4.5% protein, 0.1% carbohydrate, Bio-Serv AIN-76A) for 30 days. All animals in all treatment groups were killed in mid-morning.

In the current report, we use gnotobiotic mice to identify a metabolic cross-talk between liver and heart that is influenced by the gut microbiota. This cross-talk, which is apparent during fasting, is centered around ketone body utilization and shapes myocardial metabolism and size. Male GF mice were colonized at 6_10 weeks with a single gavage of cecal contents that had been harvested from adult CONV-R donors and resuspended in PBS (5 mL per donor; 500 _L of this suspension administered per recipient). Recipients were subsequently kept in gnotobiotic isolators and maintained for 2_3 weeks on a CARB diet. Animals were then either fasted for 24 h or continued on the CARB diet. A subset of GF and CONV-D mice was fed an irradiated sterile ketogenic diet (95.1% fat, 4.5% protein, 0.1% carbohydrate, Bio-Serv AIN-76A) for 30 days. All animals in all treatment groups were killed in mid-morning.
